# Coffee Bot

**Background**

For years I have wanted to automate the process of making coffee in the morning.  There's the daily struggle to make coffee in the morning.  It's literally the worst time to have to do complete a bunch of processes just to get going in the morning.  Especially when the process takes ten minutes and requires multiple steps to complete. The problem is similar to getting a car empty of gas to a gas station.

Most ways of making coffee require at least five steps:

- Grind coffee or open the bag
- When it's good coffee, weigh it
- Insert a filter or retrieve your French Press
- Heat and/or add water
- Turn on the coffee machine
- Wait four to five minutes

That sucks!

So as part of my career transition from finance to technology, I asked for a Raspberry Pi for Christmas to work on projects.  I got one.  A [Raspberry PI 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/), which is super powerful.  Then I started dreaming of all the things I could make with it.  Turns out you can make basically anything.  Pis run Linux, which means you can run many apps and seemingly every computer on them.  Awesome. 

So after a week of owning a Raspberry Pi and pondering what I could do with it, the idea of making a coffee maker came back to mind.  It was definitely the idea I was most passionate about.  It was also something I would use every day.  Something that would save me ten minutes every day.  So it would pay off.  Could I actually make a coffee machine?  What would I have to accomplish?  What parts do I need?  How many different components would it need?  What language would I write it in?

**Design Goals**

There were three main goals I was looking to achieve:
- Reduce the number of steps required to make coffee in the morning
- Eliminate the wait time of ~10 minutes before being able to drink coffee
- Minimize the frequency of water and coffee refills (Keurigs, which I don't use, basically have to be refilled every day)
