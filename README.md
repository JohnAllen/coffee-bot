# Coffee Bot

**Background**

For years I have wanted an automated coffee maker.  There's the daily struggle to make coffee in the morning.  It's literally the worst time to have to do something.  Especially something that takes ten minutes and requires multiple steps to complete. How do you get a car with no gas to the gas station.  That is how I see the morning coffee problem.

Most ways of making coffee require at least five steps:

- Grind coffee or open the bag
- When it's good coffee, weigh it
- Insert a filter or retrieve your French Press
- heat and/or add water
- turn it on
- wait four to five minutes

That sucks!

So as part of my career transition from finance to technology, I asked for a Raspberry Pi for Christmas to work on projects.  I got one.  A [Raspberry PI 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/), which is super powerful.  Then I started dreaming of all the things I could make with it.  Turns out you can make basically anything.  Pis run Linux, which means you can run many apps and seemingly every computer on them.  Awesome. 

So after a few weeks, the yearning for an easier way to make coffee in the morning poked its head out of my holiday consciousness, and I started wondering.  Could I actually make a coffee machine?  What would I have to accomplish?  What parts do I need?  How many different components would it need?  What language would I write it in?

**Design Goals**

There were three main goals I was looking to achieve:
- Reduce the number of steps required to make coffee in the morning
- Prevent the wait time of ~10 minutes before being able to drink coffee
- Minimize the frequency of refills (Keurigs, which I don't use basically have to be refilled every day - not convenient)
